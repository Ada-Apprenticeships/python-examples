We want to ask is a < b>

a = 1000
b = 3

Then this is negative
b - a

IF X is before Y then X is less than Y


b - a

a = 5
b = 1000

Then
b - a
is positive


a and b if comparison(a,b) is negative then a is before b
10 and 3000 if comparison(10,3000) is negative then 10 is before 3000


10 and 3000 if comparison(10,3000) is positive then b is first and is last
